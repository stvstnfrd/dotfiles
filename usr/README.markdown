# ~/.config/dotfiles/usr

## Private packages

Place your private/personal configuration packages in this directory,
but do _not_ commit them publicly.

Since this directory is already git-ignored, you could clone packages
from private repos into this directory.

### Suggested Uses
- `~/.gnupg`
- `~/.ssh`
- `~/git/config.local`
